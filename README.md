# Acknowledgement
This project would not be possible without the research conducted by [Shahneela Shaukat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahneela-shaukat/) within her project, [Finding your dream suburb in Sydney](http://res.cloudinary.com/general-assembly-profiles/image/upload/v1550727233/wlmhp4pbnl5rxupkfzrn.pdf).
Thank you!

# Summary:
Locus is a web app which allows users to get a details breakdown of the suburbs in and around Sydney, Australia.

It utilises technologies such as Ruby on Rails (backend), Google Map API, Bootstrap, JQuery, Vanilla JS.

The application is deployed on heroku and can be accessed by clicming the followning link [Locus Finder](https://www.locosfinder.herokuapp.com)

Time to complete project: 5 days.

# Features
- The application features the ability to filter suburbs based on their median rent, distance from a center point.

- Additionally you have the ability to sort the results by preference matching to your choice of ammenities.

- Each suburb page features a google map interface which 1) lists  the top 3 properties around the area, 2) calculates the commute options and times from these properties and 3) explores the area for ammenities such as public transport, recreation, schools and hospitals.

# Challenges
- Domain API - It was difficult trying to access the API through Rails.
- Trying to embed ruby into JS
- Figuring out dynamic filtering - figuring out how to filter and display the results on the same page.
- Handling asynchronous requests with the Google Map API
- Team Work - Having everyone on the same page/ challenging ideas/Different coding abilities/ Resolution of MERGE CONFLICTS!!!!!!

# Lessons learnt:
- Task management and planning.
- Writing hacky code to make the ideas work.
- Group dynamics and being adaptable to change.
- Huge benefit in having team mates that are passionate about the project.


# Feature Freeze:
- Ability to compare suburbs
- Email search results
- Questionary - getting real survey data from site users
- Real estate/property API - Most likely only possible through react.
- Live data for suburb stats via API - possibly Gov/census data.
